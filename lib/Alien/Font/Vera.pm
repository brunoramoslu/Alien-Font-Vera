Alien::Font::Vera - Access to Vera truetype file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Alien::Font::Vera;
    
    my $path = Alien::Font::Vera::path;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module was created as an optional dependency of L<Project2::Gantt>
to have access to a ttf font file.

Thus only the .ttf file is provided since this is what L<Imager> can read.

Distros might redirect to pre-existing resources.

=head1 FONT

Vera font is provided using the Bitstream license (share/License.txt) also present in this
package.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This module is inspired in L<Alien::Font::Uni> by Herbert Breunung
